HCRACK
===========

HCRACK is a HMAC-MD5 message cracker written in C.

HMAC-MD5 is sometimes used for client-side credential hashing, with a temporary key.
One of the more notable examples of this is with Pearson's PowerSchool, where HMAC is used
essentially as a method to secure credentials in absence of HTTPS.  One can sniff these
two variables, the HMAC_MD5 key and hash, and easily crack the original password with this tool.
This type of client side security is just kind of silly.


USAGE
============

Usage: hcrack [-t threads] [-h hash] [-k key] [-w wordlist]
-h hash,  		hmac hash to crack
-k key,				hmac key that goes with hash
-t threads,			number of threads to use concurrently. Default: 1
-w wordlist,			wordlist mode, follow with path to wordlist, one word per line
-b [a] [a1] [all],		(optional)character set for bruteforce: a = alphabet,
			               	a1 = alphanumerical, all = all ascii characters  Default: a1


By default, hcrack will just try to bruteforce the password with numbers and letters, up to a length of 20 characters.
Most likely, bruteforcing will either fail or take too long to be useful.  You should use a good wordlist instead.
Wordlist mode is activated with (-w).
